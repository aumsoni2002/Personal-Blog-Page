                    A little game with concealed bombs and treasure along a variable-length path to expose what is hidden at a certain point along the journey, the player must submit move location commands. The goal of the game is for the player to find as many treasures as they can before their movements or lives run out. The player's life count will be reduced if a bomb is discovered. The player will receive treasure points for discovering a treasure. Finding both a treasure and a bomb in the same spot will diminish the player's life count while also earning them treasure points (consider it a life insurance pay-out). The programme will prompt the user to do certain upfront configurations to the player and game components prior to playing the game; these settings will determine how the game is played.
