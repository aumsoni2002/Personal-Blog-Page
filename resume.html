            My name is Aum Amitkumar Soni, i am from india and i am 18 years old. I have completed my higher secondary education from Solaris Public School, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. Currently i am persuing my Advanced diploma in Computer Programming from Seneca College in Canada. In my leisure time, i love to play football or cricket with my friends, watch action/comedy films and series and spend a quality time with my family. I consider myself an extrovert because i love to meet new people and make new friends, i get excite everytime i meet strangers and talk with them. When i was in india and while doing my process for visa and collage, one thought always disturbs me that, will i able to make new friends their and will i able to talk to foreigners over thier, but it has become normal for me to talk to them. When i was young, i always wanted to make my career in football and always thought that i will be the team leader and loved to play at center forward position. But when i started growing up and became 16 or 17 years old, many prospects related to make career in football came into my mind such as it needs too much physical strength to archive a good career in any sports, there are millions of people who are working hard everyday to get one position in any big team and many more. So i dropped that idea and parallelly, i started getting interest in how people make this awesome websites and application. And after a deep research, i finally chose to become a computer programmer and will make my career in this field.

        Today, I have completed the Whole Web222 course and have learned a lot of things related to web development. The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are basic requirements to start your journey of becoming a Web developer. In this course, i came across many new features, tools, Technical terms etc which were amazing to know and using it in my assignments. Firstly, i would like to talk about HTML. HTML is like a body of any web pages. HTML consist of various types of tags, elements, attributes etc which can be help to make the programming neat, clean and can be used to handle CSS and JavaScript files. To start making a webpage, we always need to make a HTML File. The whole writting part can only be done on HTML. Secondly, i would like to talk about CSS. CSS is like a fashion/styling cloths to a body. There are tons of things such as changing font size, font color, backgroung color etc one can do to a HTML page. i have learned CSS Properties such as align, border, background, image, font, position, padding, margin etc. There are many more properties which can be used to style your HTML page. Basically CSS is used to make your HTML page look creative and attractive. Lastly, i would like to talk about JavaScript. JavaScript is like a brain of your HTML page. All the backside work of your page can be done by the JavaScript. It is little bit similar to C and C++ Programming language. I leaned to use functions, if-else statement, how to define datatypes, how to get any html 'class' and 'id' in to your JavaScript file and many more. In Technical term, the HTML and CSS are defined as Frontend languages and JavaScript is defined as both Frontend and Backend language. While working on assignments, i came across many problems, mostly related to CSS and JavaScript, but somehow with the help of Course Professor, i managed to complete them. Lastly i would like to thank Prof, Navreet Lehal, from whom i learned this course and who made this course easy to understand and fast to grasp.
